	abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (www.hmdb.ca) is a web-enabled metabolomic database containing comprehensive information about human metabolites along with their biological roles, physiological concentrations, disease associations, chemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and reference spectra. First described in 2007, the HMDB is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB's chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC-MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.},

	abstract = {Chromatographic retention time information is valuable, orthogonal information to MS and MS/MS data that can be used in metabolite identification. However, while comparison of MS data between different instruments is possible to a certain degree, retention times (RTs) can vary extensively, even when nominally the same phase system is used. Different factors such as column dead volumes, system extra column volume, and gradient dwell volume can influence absolute retention times. Retention time indexing (RTI), routinely employed in gas chromatography (e.g., Kovats index), allows compensation for deviations in experimental conditions. Different systems have been reported for RTI in liquid chromatography, but none of them have been applied to metabolomics to the same extent as they have with GC. Recently, a more universal RTI system has been reported based on a homologous series of N-alkylpyridinium sulfonates (NAPS). These reference standards ionize in both positive and negative ionization modes and are UV-active. We demonstrate the NAPS can be used for retention time indexing in reversed-phase-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (RP-LC–MS)–based metabolomics. Having measured {\textgreater}500 metabolite standards and varying flow rate and column dimension, we show that conversion of RT to retention indices (RI) substantially improves comparability of retention information and enables to use of RI for metabolite annotation and identification.},
